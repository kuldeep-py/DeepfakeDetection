Project Overview
Deepfakes are synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness. This project aims to develop a model to accurately detect deepfake videos.

Techniques Used:

Machine Learning
Computer Vision
Deep Learning
Tools and Libraries:

Python

TensorFlow/PyTorch

OpenCV

Dlib

Dataset:

[ we use dataset from kaggle of 95 thousand of image of real and fake ]

Features

Data preprocessing and augmentation.

Model architecture and training scripts.

Evaluation and performance metrics.

Sample deepfake detection results.

Deployment script for real-time detection (if applicable).


Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

git clone https://github.com/Bnl987/DeepFakeDetection.git

cd DeepFakeDetection

pip install -r requirements.txt
